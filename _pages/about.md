Hi there! My name is Wen ([pronunciation](https://translate.google.co.uk/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=%E6%96%87&op=translate)). I am currently enrolled as a Master's student in the Department of Traffic Information Engineering and Control at Jilin University. Under the guidance of Professor [Lili Zheng](https://jt.jlu.edu.cn/info/1118/4060.htm), I am actively pursuing my research and academic interests in this field. 

My research interests revolve around the construction of spatio-temporal networks in traffic flow analysis. I am particularly focused on investigating the intricate dynamics and patterns within these networks. By employing scientific theories, cutting-edge methodologies, and advanced data analysis techniques, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions and behaviors exhibited by traffic flows.
