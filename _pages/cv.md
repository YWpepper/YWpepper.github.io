Work experience
======
*  üêò [Elephant Robotics](https://github.com/elephantrobotics) (2024-01 , 2024-04)
  * Duties included: 
     1. Master the camera correction and DH parameter modeling of the robotic arm, and realize the calculation of forward and inverse kinematics of the robotic arm. 
     2. Develop a two-arm 6-axis robot in python to realize 3D object marking and target detection, and independently write and complete the identification of QR codes and grasping. Absorb the work of action groups, playing piano, keyboard and other application scenarios. 
     3. Participate in the research and development project of embodied intelligent robots, and reproduce the collection and import of action group data in the time series of the Stanford aloha robot to provide a data processing basis for later reproduction models.
  

* üè´ [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~pzq) (2024-02 , 2024-05)
  * Duties included: 
  This task aims to build a low-sample small target armored vehicle recognition algorithm model based on remote sensing images, using the YOLO model. The work content includes data collection and preprocessing, research on YOLO model principles, model training and tuning, model evaluation and performance analysis, model improvement and optimization, and result analysis and summary.
